# SVD-project
The goal of this project is to reconstruct a grayscale image using singular value decomposition. I will elaborate on the math first, and then analyze the results. 
Let A be a matrix in R^(m x n) representing our test image. Each entry represents the color grade of a pixel in the image. 255 corresponds to white, and 0 corresponds to black. Values in between are different shades of gray. Our goal is to reconstruct our test image as closely as possible using a low rank approximation of A. 
First let us derive the SVD formula, which is $A= (U)(\Sigma)(V^T)$, where $V$ is R^(n x n), $\Sigma$ is R^(m x n), and $U$ is R^(m x m). Consider $(A^T)(A)$, which is n x n. The image shows that (A^T)(A) is symmetric and postive semidefinite. Using the spectral theorem, we can conclude that (A^T)(A) has real eigenvalues and there exists a basis of R^n consisting of eigenvectors of (A^T)(A). This means that there exists $V= (v_1, v_2,...,v_n)$ such that $v_i$ are eigenvectors of (A^T)(A) and comprise of a basis of R^n, meaning that they are orthonormal. What we want to do is to find unit vectors, $u_i$, in R^m, and singular values ($/sigma) such that $A(v_i)= (/sigma_i)(u_i)$. Let $lambda_i$ be the eigenvalues of A, meaning that $A(v_i)= (lambda_i)(v_i)$. Let $sigma_i= sqrt(lamba_i)$
